# Super-Marker-Bill-Management
The Super Market Billing System is a console-based application developed in C++. This application allows users to add items to a bill, manage item inventory, and print out bills. The system reads and writes data to a text file, ensuring that item information is persistent between sessions.

Features
Add Items: Allows users to add items with a name, rate, and quantity.
Print Bills: Users can print bills, including the total amount due.
Manage Inventory: The system manages item inventory, reducing quantities as items are added to bills.
File Handling: Reads from and writes to a text file to store item information.
Technologies Used
C++ Standard Library
File I/O Operations
Windows-specific functions (system("cls") and Sleep())

bill.txt: Stores item information (name, rate, and quantity).
main.cpp: Main source code for the application.
README.md: Project documentation.
Setup and Usage
Prerequisites
Windows operating system (for system("cls") and Sleep() functions)
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/super-market-billing-system.git
cd super-market-billing-system
Compile the Source Code:

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o billing_system
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
./billing_system
Adding Items
Select the option to add items from the main menu.
Enter the item name, rate, and quantity when prompted.
The item details are stored in bill.txt.
Printing Bills
Select the option to print a bill from the main menu.
Enter the item name and quantity when prompted.
The application calculates the total amount and updates the inventory in bill.txt.
Customization
Changing File Paths
If you want to change the file paths for storing item information, modify the paths in the relevant sections of the main.cpp file:

cpp
Copy code
ofstream out("new_bill_path.txt", ios::app);
ifstream in("new_bill_path.txt");
Adjusting Sleep Duration
The sleep durations can be adjusted by modifying the values passed to the Sleep() function:

cpp
Copy code
Sleep(3000);
Replacing System Calls
To make the code platform-independent, replace Windows-specific functions (system("cls") and Sleep()) with standard C++ functions or libraries.
